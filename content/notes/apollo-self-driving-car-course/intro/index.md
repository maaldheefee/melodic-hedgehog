This is an introduction course to self-driving cars and Apollo platform - The Android of Self-Driving Car. Through this course, you will be able to identify key parts of self-driving cars and get to know Apollo architecture. You will be able to utilize Apollo HD Map, localization, perception, prediction, planning and control, and start the learning path of building a self-driving car.
